# WinOS

Here is a set of useful tools on Windows I often use. 

You can also link to [LaTeXChecker](https://github.com/BatchClayderman/LaTeXChecker) for other tools. 

## adjustCalendar.py

This script can help handle some calendar issues in bulk. 

It can be used to remove online course arrangements from the calendar. 

## aobiAdb.py

This script is used for Android automatic control based on uiautomator2. 

Currently, this script is no longer under maintenance due to the following limitations. 

1) This script cannot follow the Android screen in real time. 
2) No multiple points are supported while I expect to have ``p1, p2 = Point(), Point()``, ``p1.click(x, y)``, ``p2.wrap(x1, y1, x2, y2)``, and ``Point.commit(p1, p2)``.
3) Using a simulator may be more useful in these tasks than writing a script to control Android devices via personal computers. 

## WinOS.py

This script is a tool used very frequently on the Windows platform.
